## important data engineering concepts

### Operational and Analytical data
- Operational data is usually transactional data that is generated and stored by applications, often in a relational or non-relational database.
- Analytical data is data that has been optimized for analysis and reporting, often in a data warehouse.

### Streaming data
- Streaming data refers to perpetual sources of data that generate data values in real-time, often relating to specific events.
- solutions that capture real-time stream of data and ingest them into analytical data systems, often combining the real-time data with other application data that is processed in batches

### data Pipelines
- Data pipelines are used to orchestrate activities that transfer and transform data.
- peatable extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions that can be triggered based on a schedule or in response to events.

### Data lakes
- A data lake is a storage repository that holds large amounts of data in native, raw formats.
- Data lake stores are optimized for scaling to massive volumes (terabytes or petabytes) of data. The data typically comes from multiple heterogeneous sources, and may be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
- The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and processes the data at the time of ingestion.

### Data Warehouses 
- A data warehouse is a centralized repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data in relational tables that are organized into a schema that optimizes performance for analytical queries.
- designing and implementing relational data warehouses, and managing regular data loads into tables.

### Apache Spark 
- Apache Spark is a parallel processing framework that takes advantage of in-memory processing and a distributed file storage. It's a common open-source software (OSS) tool for big data scenarios.
